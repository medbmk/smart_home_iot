The aim of this project is to design and simulate a Smart Home system using IoT technologies, focusing on:

Automation (e.g. doors, lighting, temperature)

Security (e.g. password access, motion detection)

Cloud connectivity for real-time monitoring and data storage

Visualization via mobile app and online dashboards
